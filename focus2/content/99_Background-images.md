Controlling the Focus2 background images
----

Focus2 comes with the functionality to create a single fullscreen slideshow with thumbnail control as well as up to 7 background slideshows without thumbnail control. The following refers to controlling the background images without thumbnail control.


Selecting background images to be displayed

The Focus2 template allows the user to display fullwidth background images across 7 rows of content on the page. Each row consists of a series of grid positions:

- Grid-block-1: grid1, grid2, grid3, grid4
- Grid-block-2: grid5, grid6, grid7, grid8
- Grid-block-3: grid9, grid10, gri11, grid12
- Grid-block-4: grid13, grid14, grid15, grid16
- Grid-block-5: grid17, grid18, grid19, grid20
- Grid-block-6: grid21, grid22, gri23, grid24
- Bottom: bottom1,bottom2,bottom3,bottom4,bottom5,bottom6

Each image or group of images is selected from a single folder via the template settings.

![Background Images](../data/focus2/images/background-images/background-images.jpg)

To disable the background image set the corresponding option to none.

Background images are only used if the corresponding row has a module published to it.
