Adding a hidden panel
----

Zen Grid Framework v4 (ZGF4) based themes also include a useful hidden panel for displaying content in a floating panel above the page. The panel trigger is automatically displayed on the page when any module is published to the panel position. After clicking the panel trigger, a floating panel appears above the page displaying your panel content.

Colours and other settings for the hidden panel are easily configured in the template settings. After changing values in the hidden panel ensure that you click the compile less button.
