### Off Canvas Trigger
The three lined icon in the top right of the page is the trigger that opens the off canvas menu or off canvas panel. This icon will automatically appear when a module is published to the offcanvas position or when the offcanvas menu is selected in the template's responsive settings.

The icon requires the use of the Font Awesome library which is included in the template by default.
